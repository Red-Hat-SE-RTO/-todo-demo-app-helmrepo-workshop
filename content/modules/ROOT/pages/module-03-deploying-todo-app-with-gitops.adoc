= Module 3: Deploying the Todo App with GitOps

[%hardbreaks]
== Module Overview

This module focuses on deploying a Todo application using GitOps principles. Participants will learn how to set up a GitOps repository, define the desired state of the application, and use Argo CD for deployment. Additionally, they will explore Gitea as an alternative Git service and perform hands-on tasks to deploy the Todo app using GitOps.

== Key Learning Objectives

* Understand the GitOps workflow for application deployment.
* Learn how to set up and manage a GitOps repository.
* Use Argo CD for real-time synchronization and health monitoring.
* Explore Gitea as a self-hosted Git service and its integration with Argo CD.
* Deploy a Todo app using GitOps principles and observe automated deployment processes.

== Setting up the GitOps Repository

=== Initializing the Git Repository

Below is an example of creating a repo to be used for GitOps. Follow these steps:

* Create a new repository on your preferred Git hosting service (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
* Clone the repository to your local machine:
[source,bash]
----
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-name>
----
* Initialize the GitOps structure by creating the following directories:
[source,bash]
----
mkdir -p manifests/base manifests/overlays/production
----
* Add the necessary Kubernetes manifests (e.g., deployment.yaml, service.yaml) to the `manifests/base` directory.
* Commit and push the changes to the repository:
[source,bash]
----
git add .
git commit -m "Initialize GitOps repository"
git push origin main
----

=== GitOps-Compatible Structure

Ensure your repository follows a GitOps-compatible structure. This typically includes:

* A `base` directory for common configurations.
* An `overlays` directory for environment-specific configurations (e.g., production, staging).
* Kubernetes manifests (YAML files) defining the desired state of the application.

== Defining the Desired State

=== Key Resources

The desired state of the Todo application in Git. Key resources include:

* **Deployment:** Specifies the desired state of the application pods.
* **Service:** Exposes the application to the network.
* **ConfigMap/Secret:** Stores configuration data and sensitive information.
* **Route:** to be used for comminucation into the application.

=== Version Control and Traceability

* Use Git branches for different environments (e.g., main for production, develop for staging).
* Tag releases for traceability and rollback capabilities.
* Maintain detailed commit messages to track changes.

== Using Argo CD for Deployment

=== Synchronizing with Argo CD

When using Argo CD to synchronize the application deployment on OpenShift with the Git repository:

* Install Argo CD on your OpenShift cluster.
* Create an Argo CD application pointing to your Git repository:
[source,bash]
----
argocd app create todo-app \
   --repo <repository-url> \
   --path manifests/overlays/production \
   --dest-server https://kubernetes.default.svc \
   --dest-namespace default
----
* Sync the application to deploy it:
[source,bash]
----
argocd app sync todo-app
----

=== Real-Time Synchronization and Health Monitoring

ArgoCD has  features such as:

* **Real-Time Synchronization:** Automatically updates the deployment when changes are pushed to the Git repository.
* **Health Monitoring:** Monitors the health of the application and reports any issues.

=== Integration with Argo CD

* **Repository Authentication:** Use Gitea tokens for authentication.
* **Webhooks:** Configure webhooks in Gitea to trigger Argo CD synchronization.

== Hands-On Task

=== Deploying the Todo App

*Navigate to the Gitea Project*
