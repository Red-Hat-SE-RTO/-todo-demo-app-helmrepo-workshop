== Module 6: Advanced Tekton Techniques (Optional)

=== Progressive Delivery with Tekton

==== Introduction

Progressive delivery is a strategy that allows for the gradual rollout of new software versions, reducing the risk of deployment failures. Tekton, combined with Kubernetes features, can facilitate canary and blue/green deployments.

==== Canary Deployments

A canary deployment involves rolling out a new version of an application to a small subset of users before fully deploying it. This allows for testing the new version in a live environment with real user traffic.

===== Tekton Implementation

- Create a Tekton pipeline that deploys the new version of the application to a small percentage of pods.
- Use Kubernetes features like `PodDisruptionBudgets` and `HorizontalPodAutoscaler` to manage the rollout.
- Monitor key metrics (e.g., response time, error rate) and gradually increase the percentage of traffic to the new version based on performance.

==== Blue/Green Deployments

A blue/green deployment involves running two identical production environments (blue and green) simultaneously. The new version is deployed to the inactive environment (green), tested, and then switched to become the active environment.

**Argo CD Blue/Green Deployment Guide**

===== Tekton Implementation

- Create a Tekton pipeline that deploys the new version of the application to the green environment.
- Use Kubernetes services to switch traffic from the blue environment to the green environment once the new version is verified.
- Ensure that the old version (blue) can be quickly rolled back if issues arise.

=== Multi-Environment Deployments

==== Introduction

Managing deployments across multiple environments (e.g., development, staging, production) requires dynamic configuration and environment-specific settings.

==== Pipeline Parameters and Workspaces

===== Pipeline Parameters

- Use `PipelineParameters` to pass environment-specific configurations to the pipeline.
- Example: Define parameters for different environments (e.g., `env=dev`, `env=staging`, `env=prod`).

**Tekton Documentation**

- https://tekton.dev/docs/pipelines/pipelines/#specifying-parameters[Specifying Parameters]

===== Workspaces

- Use `Workspaces` to share data between tasks in the pipeline.
- Example: Store environment-specific configuration files in a workspace and use them in different tasks.

==== Debugging TaskRuns

Tekton allows you to debug `TaskRuns` by setting breakpoints and inspecting the execution environment.

**Adding Breakpoints:**

- Modify the `TaskRun` to include a debug breakpoint.
- This halts execution at a specified step, allowing inspection.

**Inspecting the Environment:**

- Access the pod associated with the `TaskRun`.
- Use standard debugging tools to inspect files, environment variables, and running processes.

==== Common Issues and Solutions

**TaskRun Failures:**

**Issue:** A `TaskRun` fails unexpectedly.

**Solution:**

- Check the logs for error messages.
- Verify that all required resources and parameters are correctly defined.
- Ensure that the
