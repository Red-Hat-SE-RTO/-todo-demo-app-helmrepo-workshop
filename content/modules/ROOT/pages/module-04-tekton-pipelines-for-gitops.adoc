= Module 4: Tekton Pipelines for GitOps

[%hardbreaks]
== Module Overview

This module focuses on leveraging Tekton pipelines to automate CI/CD workflows in a GitOps context. Participants will gain insights into how Tekton integrates with GitOps principles, enabling seamless and automated deployments.

== Key Learning Objectives

* Understand the integration of Tekton with GitOps
* Learn how to build and push container images using Tekton
* Explore the core concepts of Tekton pipelines
* Develop hands-on skills in configuring and running Tekton pipelines
* Understand troubleshooting techniques for common pipeline issues

== Tekton and GitOps

Tekton pipelines enable GitOps by triggering deployments based on changes in a Git repository. This approach ensures that updates in the source code or configuration files are automatically reflected in the pipeline workflow.

== Building and Pushing Images with Tekton

Tekton pipelines are powerful tools for automating the building of container images and pushing them to Quay. This integration is a key part of the GitOps workflow, as it simplifies and secures the image management process.

== Understanding the Logic of Tekton Pipelines (For New Users)

Tekton pipelines follow a declarative approach to define the steps in a CI/CD workflow. Here's a breakdown of the core concepts:

=== Pipelines
- A **Pipeline** is the overall workflow, consisting of a series of tasks executed in sequence or parallel.
- Each pipeline defines:
  - **Parameters**: Inputs to the pipeline (e.g., image URLs, Git repository URLs).
  - **Tasks**: The individual steps performed in the workflow.

=== Tasks
- A **Task** is a sequence of steps that perform a specific action, such as building a container image or running tests.
- Each task defines:
  - **Steps**: The individual commands or scripts executed in the task.
  - **Workspaces**: Shared storage areas used to pass data between tasks.

=== PipelinesRuns
- A **PipelineRun** is an instance of a pipeline that is executed with specific inputs and parameters.
- It tracks the execution status and logs of the pipeline.

=== TaskRuns
- A **TaskRun** is an instance of a task that is executed as part of a pipeline.
- It tracks the execution status and logs of the task.

== Hands-On Exercises

In this section, participants will engage in practical exercises to reinforce their understanding of Tekton pipelines and GitOps. Exercises will include:

- Configuring a Tekton pipeline to build and push a container image.
- Triggering a pipeline run based on a Git commit.
- Troubleshooting common pipeline issues.
