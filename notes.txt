**Workshop Title:** GitOps-Driven CI/CD on OpenShift with Tekton Pipelines and Quay

**Target Audience:** Developers and DevOps engineers with some Kubernetes experience, interested in implementing GitOps principles for CI/CD on OpenShift.

**Workshop Outline:**

**1. Introduction to Tekton, GitOps and OpenShift**

*   **What is GitOps?** Explain the core principles and benefits of GitOps for managing infrastructure and applications.
*   **Why GitOps with OpenShift?** Explain how OpenShift provides a robust platform for GitOps workflows with built-in support for Argo CD and Tekton.
*   **OpenShift GitOps and Argo CD:** Deep dive into Argo CD as the GitOps engine in OpenShift, emphasizing its role in continuous delivery and automated deployments.
*   **Tekton's Role in GitOps:**
    *   Introduce Tekton as the CI component within the GitOps workflow.
    *   Explain how Tekton pipelines automate the build, test, and delivery stages of the CI/CD process.
    *   Highlight how Tekton integrates with Argo CD to trigger deployments based on Git changes.
*   **Kubernetes Management Tools:** Briefly introduce different tools for managing Kubernetes deployments:
    *   **Kustomize:** Highlight its strengths in customizing base YAML files and managing simple deployments.
    *   **Helm:** Discuss its templating engine and package management capabilities for deploying complex applications.

**2. Quay and OpenShift Pipelines**

*   **Introduction to Quay:** Red Hat Quay is a robust container registry that stores, builds, and deploys container images. In the CI/CD pipeline, Quay serves as a central repository for container images, facilitating efficient storage, versioning, and distribution. It also offers features like image vulnerability scanning and mirroring, enhancing security and reliability in the development workflow. 

*   **Integrating Quay with OpenShift Pipelines:** To automate the CI/CD process, integrate Quay with OpenShift Pipelines (based on Tekton). This integration allows pipelines to push newly built images to Quay and trigger subsequent tasks, such as deployments or notifications. For instance, configuring Tekton pipelines to push images to Quay can be achieved by creating a secret with Quay credentials and referencing it in the pipeline tasks. 

*   **Security Considerations:** Securing container images in Quay involves implementing best practices such as enabling image vulnerability scanning, using signed images, and enforcing access controls. Integrating security tools like Sigstore and Tekton Chains can further enhance the security posture by providing image signing and verification capabilities. 

*   **Hands-on Exercise:** Participants will configure Quay integration within their OpenShift Pipelines setup. This includes creating a Quay repository, setting up necessary credentials, and modifying pipeline configurations to push images to Quay. Additionally, participants will implement security measures such as enabling image scanning and signing to ensure the integrity and security of their container images.  

**3. Tekton Pipelines for GitOps**

*   **Tekton and GitOps:** Explain how Tekton pipelines can trigger deployments based on changes in the Git repository.
*   **Building and Pushing Images:** Demonstrate how to use Tekton to build container images and push them to Quay, initiating the GitOps deployment process.
*   **Tekton and Argo CD Integration:**  Show how to integrate Tekton with Argo CD for a seamless GitOps workflow.
*   **(Hands-on):** Participants modify Tekton pipelines to work with Argo CD and trigger deployments based on Git events.

**4. Deploying the Todo App with GitOps**

*   **Setting up the GitOps Repository:** Guide participants through setting up a Git repository with the necessary configuration files for the Todo application.
*   **Defining the Desired State:**  Explain how to define the desired state of the application in Git, including deployments, services, and other resources.
*   **Using Argo CD for Deployment:**  Demonstrate how to use Argo CD to synchronize the application deployment on OpenShift with the Git repository.
*   **(Hands-on):** Participants deploy the Todo app using GitOps principles, observing how Argo CD automates the process.

**5. Managing and Updating Applications with GitOps**
 
*   **Making Changes through Git:**  Show how to update the application by making changes to the configuration files in the Git repository.
*   **Automated Updates with Argo CD:**  Demonstrate how Argo CD automatically detects changes in the Git repository and deploys the updates to OpenShift.
*   **Rollbacks and Version Control:**  Explain how GitOps facilitates rollbacks and version control for application deployments.
*   **(Hands-on):** Participants update the Todo app and practice performing rollbacks using Git and Argo CD.

**6. Advanced GitOps Techniques (Optional)**

*   **Progressive Delivery:** Introduce techniques like canary deployments and blue/green deployments using Argo CD.
*   **Multi-Environment Deployments:**  Discuss strategies for managing deployments across different environments (e.g., development, staging, production) with GitOps.
*   **Observability and Monitoring:**  Show how to integrate observability tools for monitoring application health and troubleshooting deployments.
*   **(Hands-on):** Participants can engage in advanced exercises or demonstrations based on their interests and skill levels.

This comprehensive outline provides a structured and engaging learning experience for your participants, equipping them with the knowledge and skills to implement GitOps-driven CI/CD on OpenShift.
