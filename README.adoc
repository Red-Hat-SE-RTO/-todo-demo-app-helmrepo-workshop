= GitOps-Driven CI/CD Workshop on OpenShift with Tekton Pipelines and Quay

== Welcome to the GitOps-Driven CI/CD Workshop on OpenShift with Tekton Pipelines and Quay

This workshop aims to introduce participants to the world of GitOps and its applications in continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) on OpenShift using Tekton pipelines and Quay. The workshop is designed for developers and DevOps engineers with some Kubernetes experience, interested in implementing GitOps principles for CI/CD on OpenShift.

== Learning Objectives

By the end of this workshop, participants will be able to:

* Understand the core concepts of GitOps and its benefits for CI/CD
* Learn to implement GitOps workflows on OpenShift using Tekton and Argo CD
* Gain experience managing application deployments through Git repositories
* Integrate Quay into the GitOps pipeline for container image management

== Workshop Outline

The workshop will cover the following topics:

1. **Introduction to GitOps and OpenShift**
	* What is GitOps?
	* Kubernetes management tools: Kustomize, Helm, and Argo CD
	* Why GitOps with OpenShift?
2. **Quay and OpenShift GitOps**
	* Introduction to Quay
	* Connecting Quay with Argo CD
	* Security considerations for container images in Quay and GitOps
	* Hands-on: Configure Quay integration in your GitOps repository
3. **Tekton Pipelines for GitOps**
	* Tekton and GitOps
	* Building and pushing images using Tekton
	* Tekton and Argo CD integration
	* Hands-on: Modify Tekton pipelines to work with Argo CD and trigger deployments
4. **Deploying the Todo App with GitOps**
	* Setting up the GitOps repository
	* Defining the desired state of the application
	* Using Argo CD for deployment
	* Hands-on: Deploy the Todo app using GitOps principles
5. **Managing and Updating Applications with GitOps**
	* Making changes through Git
	* Automated updates with Argo CD
	* Rollbacks and version control with GitOps
	* Hands-on: Update the Todo app and practice rollbacks using Git and Argo CD
6. **Advanced GitOps Techniques (Optional)**
	* Progressive delivery: canary deployments and blue/green deployments
	* Multi-environment deployments
	* Observability and monitoring
	* Hands-on: Engage in advanced exercises or demonstrations

== Prerequisites

To get the most out of this workshop, participants should have:

* Basic knowledge of Kubernetes and container orchestration
* Familiarity with Git and version control systems
* Access to a local OpenShift cluster or a cloud-based OpenShift deployment
* Tekton and Argo CD installed and configured on your OpenShift cluster
